# 🚀 **RIZE**: ***Regularized Imitation Learning via Distributional Reinforcement Learning***

---

## 📖 Summary

*RIZE* is a novel inverse reinforcement learning method that enhances ***Maximum Entropy IRL*** by incorporating a squared temporal-difference regularizer with adaptive, dynamically evolving targets, enabling more stable and flexible reward learning. It integrates distributional reinforcement learning to capture richer return distributions, improving value function representation. ***RIZE*** achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging continuous control benchmarks in ***MuJoCo***, including expert-level performance on the ***Humanoid*** task with only three demonstrations.
