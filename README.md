## üìñ Summary

RIZE is a non-adversarial inverse reinforcement learning framework that unifies implicit reward regularization with distributional reinforcement learning. It extends IQ-Learn and LS-IQ by replacing fixed implicit reward targets with adaptive, learnable targets that evolve during training, constraining rewards to improve stability and prevent divergence.

To capture richer return information, RIZE trains quantile-based distributional critics and uses their expectations for policy updates‚Äîpreserving theoretical guarantees while improving robustness in high-dimensional control. This combination yields bounded critic values, more stable policy optimization, and better sample efficiency.

On MuJoCo benchmarks, RIZE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving expert-level Humanoid performance with only three demonstrations‚Äîa setting where all baselines fail. Extensive ablations confirm that both adaptive regularization and distributional value functions are essential for its gains.
